Project README
Overview
This project includes basic Python scripts and Terraform files for managing Okta configurations. The primary purpose of these scripts is to generate Terraform configurations for Okta users and groups based on CSV data.

Files Description
Python Scripts

oktaUserTfGenerator.py: Generates Terraform configuration for Okta users. It reads data from okta_users.csv and produces oktaUsers.tf.
oktaGroupTfGenerator.py: Generates Terraform configuration for Okta groups. It uses okta_groups.csv as input to create oktaGroups.tf.
Terraform Files

oktaUsers.tf: Terraform configuration for Okta users. This file is generated by oktaUserTfGenerator.py.
oktaGroups.tf: Terraform configuration for Okta groups. Generated by oktaGroupTfGenerator.py.
CSV Files

okta_users.csv: Contains data for Okta users. This is the input for the oktaUserTfGenerator.py script.
okta_groups.csv: Contains data for Okta groups, used by oktaGroupTfGenerator.py.
Usage
To use these scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Run the Python scripts to generate the Terraform files. After generation, use Terraform to apply these configurations to your Okta environment.

Additional Information
The Python scripts provided are basic and primarily focused on generating Terraform configurations from CSV data.
For more advanced configurations or customization, refer to the Terraform Okta provider documentation.
Ensure you have appropriate access and permissions in your Okta environment before applying these configurations.
Important Notes
Always validate the generated Terraform files before applying them.
Backup your existing Okta configuration as a precaution before making any changes.
